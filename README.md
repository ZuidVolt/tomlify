Clone the repository and make the script executable:

## üöÄ Usage

Basic usage - creates pyproject.toml in current directory:

```bash
/path/to/tomlify.py
```

Using a custom template:

```bash
/path/to/tomlify.py -t /path/to/custom/template.toml
```

Specifying an output directory:

```bash
/path/to/tomlify.py -o /path/to/project/directory
```

You can also create an alias for the script in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
alias tomlify='/path/to/tomlify.py'
```

Command Line Options:

- `-t, --template`: Specify a custom template file path
- `-o, --output`: Specify the output directory for pyproject.toml

The script will:

1. Verify permissions and file health
2. Create a new `pyproject.toml` if none exists
3. Prompt for confirmation before overwriting an existing file
4. Automatically create a backup of any existing configuration
